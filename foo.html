        <h4>Credit Ratings</h4>
    <p>
        The Website at emma.msrb.org displays ratings for municipal securities currently assigned by Fitch Ratings, Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc., Moody's (as defined below) and
        Standard and Poor's (S&#38;P) based on their agreement with the MSRB to make them available to the public through the Website. WEBSITE USERS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT RATINGS INFORMATION APPEARING ON THE 
        WEBSITE IS CURRENT AS OF THE "LAST UPDATED" DATE AND TIME INDICATED ON THE WEBSITE, AND THE MSRB TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR INDEPENDENTLY VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OR TIMELINESS OF THE RATINGS 
        INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE RATING AGENCIES THROUGH THEIR DATA FEEDS. THE WEBSITE DISPLAYS ONLY THE CURRENT RATINGS INFORMATION FOR ANY SECURITY AND DOES NOT DISPLAY HISTORICAL RATINGS INFORMATION. 
        Thus, if the rating for a municipal security has been changed by a rating agency, the prior rating will no longer be accessible through the Website. At times, rating agencies may take rating actions 
        that are not immediately included in the data feeds but may instead be released initially through other means, such as a press release or spreadsheet posted on their websites. 
        To view any potential rating action that may have been taken by a rating agency on a municipal security since the last update received by the Website, or to understand the meaning of the ratings 
        and other information provided by each rating agency, please refer to the information available on those agencies' websites.

            Moody's Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Corporation ("MCO"), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities 
            (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, 
            agreed to pay to Moody's Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies 
            and procedures to address the independence of MIS's ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, 
            and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading

            Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of MOODY'S credit ratings and MOODY'S publications is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY'S

            ratings and MOODY'S publications are intended to be provided only to "wholesale clients" within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access MOODY'S 
            information displayed on the Website from within Australia, you represent to MOODY'S that you are, or are accessing this information as a representative of, a "wholesale client" and that

            available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY'S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision.

            Organization ("NRSRO"). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, 
            the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and 
            their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated 
            by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from 
            JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000.
        </p>
